-Logging
	-Was able to log the whole night!
	
-Grid eye
	-Promising signs that this sensor will be a valid way to detect REM
	-unexpectedly, std dev showed clear distinctions in rem/non rem sleep- more than frame change average
	-will have to build in and tune moving average
	-was not able to correlate to lack of accelerometer activity, see below
	
-Accelerometer
	- Quite a bit of noise
	- X showed the same value for the whole night, and was a very negative value (like ~-500 or similar)
	- Need to troubleshoot

To do:
- integrate maoving average into current stats and tune
- troubleshoot accelerometer
